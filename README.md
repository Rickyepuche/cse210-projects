# 👋 Hi, I'm Richard Edigin

**C# Student Developer | Future Software Engineer | Tech Explorer**

I'm a curious and passionate learner from Nigeria, currently taking **CSE 210: Programming with Classes** through BYU Pathway. In this course, I'm learning the fundamentals of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** using **C#**, and building console-based projects that demonstrate real-world problem solving with classes, objects, abstraction, encapsulation, and inheritance.

## 💻 What I'm Learning

- Writing clean, structured C# programs
- Designing and using classes and objects effectively
- Applying principles like **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism**
- Thinking like a software developer and breaking problems into reusable parts

## 🧠 About Me

- 🎓 I'm a university student passionate about tech, learning how to turn ideas into working code.
- 🚀 I love creating apps that can solve real-world problems, especially in education, entertainment, and AI.
- 🌱 Outside of CSE 210, I'm exploring **Python**, **React Native**, and **AI tools** for future projects.
